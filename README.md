# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is the act of using another person’s credit card to make purchases or request cash advances without the cardholder’s knowledge or consent. These criminals may obtain the card itself through physical theft, though increasingly fraudsters are leveraging digital means to steal the credit card number and accompanying personal information to make illicit transactions.

There is some overlap between identity theft and credit card theft. In fact, credit card theft is one of the most common forms of identity theft. In such cases, a fraudster uses an individual’s personal information, which is often stolen as part of a cyberattack or data breach, to open a new account that the victim does not know about. This activity is considered both identity fraud and credit card fraud.
